***************************
Question and Answering (QA)
***************************

The Question and Answering service is a tool allowing to extract response from a document according to a given query.
This tools is a rest service where the API is described in **API section** and the configuration file is described in **Configuration section**.

==========================
Question and Answering API
==========================

.. openapi:: ../resources/api/qa.json


====================================
Question and Answering configuration
====================================

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../app/projects/default/configs/qa.json
    :language: json

Question and Answering configuration is an aggreation of network configuration, serialize configuration, runtime configuration (in field converter), logger (at top level).


Configure Question and Answering logger
---------------------------------------

Logger is configuration at top level of json in *logger* field.

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../configuration/examples/loggerconfiguration.json
    :language: json

The logger fields are:

* **logging-file** is the filename of the log file (notice that "-<logname>" will be added to this name=
* **logging-path** is the path to the logfile (if it does not exist it will be created)
* **logging-level** contains two fields:
    
  * **file** for the logging level of the file
  * **screen** for the logging level on screen output

    Both can be set to the following values:

  * **debug** for the debug level and developper information
  * **info** for the level of information
  * **warning** to display only warning and errors
  * **error** to display only error

Configure Question and Answering Network
----------------------------------------

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../configuration/examples/networkconfiguration.json
    :language: json


The network fields:

* **host** : hostname
* **port** : port of the service
* **associated-environement** : is the "host" and "port" associated environment variables that allows to replace the 
    default one. This field is not mandatory.

  * "host" : associated "host" environment variable
  * "port" : associated "port" environment variable

* **ssl** : ssl configuration **IN PRODUCTION IT IS MANDATORY TO USE CERTIFICATE AND KEY THAT ARE *NOT* SELF SIGNED**
  
  * **cert** : certificate file
  * **key** : key file 

Configure Question and Answering Serialize
------------------------------------------

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../configuration/examples/serializeconfiguration.json
    :language: json

The serialize fields:

* **input** : serialize input of service

  * **path** : path of serialized fields
  * **keep-service-info** : True if serialize info is kept
  * **associated-environement** : is the "path" and "keep-service-info" associated environment variables that allows to replace the  default one. This field is not mandatory.

    * **path** : associated "path" environment variable
    * **keep-service-info** : associated "keep-service-info" environment variable

* output : serialize output of service

  * **path** : path of serialized fields
  * **keep-service-info** : True if serialize info is kept
  * **associated-environement** : if the "path" and "keep-service-info" associated environment variables that allows to replace the  default one. This field is not mandatory.
      
    * **path** : associated "path" environment variable
    * **keep-service-info** : associated "keep-service-info" environment variable
  
Configure Question and Answering runtime
----------------------------------------

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../configuration/examples/runtimeconfiguration.json
    :language: json


The Runtime fields:
  
* **request-max-size** : how big a request may be (bytes)
* **request-buffer-queue-size**: request streaming buffer queue size
* **request-timeout** : how long a request can take to arrive (sec)
* **response-timeout** : how long a response can take to process (sec)
* **keep-alive**: keep-alive 
* **keep-alive-timeout**: how long to hold a TCP connection open (sec)
* **graceful-shutdown_timeout** : how long to wait to force close non-idle connection (sec)
* **workers** : number of workers for the service on a node
* **associated-environement** : if one of previous field is on the associated environment variables that allows to replace the  default one. This field is not mandatory.

  * **request-max-size** : overwrite with environement variable
  * **request-buffer-queue-size**: overwrite with environement variable
  * **request-timeout** : overwrite with environement variable
  * **response-timeout** : overwrite with environement variable
  * **keep-alive**: overwrite with environement variable
  * **keep-alive-timeout**: overwrite with environement variable
  * **graceful-shutdown_timeout** : overwrite with environement variable
  * **workers** : overwrite with environement variable
  


==============================
Question and Answering service
==============================

To run the command type simply from searchai directory:

.. code-block:: shell 
  
    python3 thot/qa_svc.py --config=<path to qa configuration file>

A light client can be run through the command

.. code-block:: shell 
  
    python3 thot/qa_client.py --config=<path to qa configuration file> --input=<input directory> --output=<output directory> --queries=<queries file>

Example of Queries:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../thot/tests/data/qa_queries.json
    :language: json    


============================
Question and Answering Tests
============================

The Question and Answering service come with unit and functional testing. 


QA Unit tests
-------------

Unittest allows to test Tokenizer classes only.

.. code-block:: shell 

  python3 -m unittest thot/tests/unittests/TestQAConfiguration.py
  python3 -m unittest thot/tests/unittests/TestQAExtractor.py


QA Functional tests
-------------------

.. code-block:: shell 

  python3 -m unittest thot/tests/functional_tests/TestQASvc.py
