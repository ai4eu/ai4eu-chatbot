*******************
Cluster Inference
*******************

The Cluster Inference is a tool allowing to infer cluster classes on knowledge graph entries
This tools is a rest service.

=======================
Cluster Inference API
=======================

.. openapi:: ../resources/api/clusterinfer.json

This API is also available via the service itself on http://<service host>:<service port>/swagger

=================================
Cluster Inference configuration
=================================

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../app/projects/default/configs/relations.json
    :language: json


Configure cluster inference logger
------------------------------------

Logger is configuration at top level of json in *logger* field.

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../configuration/examples/loggerconfiguration.json
    :language: json

The logger fields are:

* **logging-file** is the filename of the log file (notice that "-<logname>" will be added to this name=
* **logging-path** is the path to the logfile (if it does not exist it will be created)
* **logging-level** contains two fields:
  
  * **file** for the logging level of the file
  * **screen** for the logging level on screen output

  Both can be set to the following values:

  * **debug** for the debug level and developper information
  * **info** for the level of information
  * **warning** to display only warning and errors
  * **error** to display only error

Configure cluster inference Network
------------------------------------

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../configuration/examples/networkconfiguration.json
    :language: json


The network fields:

* **host** : hostname
* **port** : port of the service
* **associated-environement** : is the "host" and "port" associated environment variables that allows to replace the 
  default one. This field is not mandatory.

  * "host" : associated "host" environment variable
  * "port" : associated "port" environment variable

* **ssl** : ssl configuration **IN PRODUCTION IT IS MANDATORY TO USE CERTIFICATE AND KEY THAT ARE *NOT* SELF SIGNED**
  
  * **cert** : certificate file
  * **key** : key file 

Configure cluster inference Serialize
-------------------------------------

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../configuration/examples/serializeconfiguration.json
    :language: json

The serialize fields:

* **input** : serialize input of service

  * **path** : path of serialized fields
  * **keep-service-info** : True if serialize info is kept
  * **associated-environement** : is the "path" and "keep-service-info" associated environment variables that allows to replace the  default one. This field is not mandatory.

    * **path** : associated "path" environment variable
    * **keep-service-info** : associated "keep-service-info" environment variable

* output : serialize output of service

  * **path** : path of serialized fields
  * **keep-service-info** : True if serialize info is kept
  * **associated-environement** : if the "path" and "keep-service-info" associated environment variables that allows to replace the  default one. This field is not mandatory.
    
    * **path** : associated "path" environment variable
    * **keep-service-info** : associated "keep-service-info" environment variable
  
Configure cluster inference runtime
-----------------------------------

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: ../configuration/examples/runtimeconfiguration.json
    :language: json


The Runtime fields:
  
* **request-max-size** : how big a request may be (bytes)
* **request-buffer-queue-size**: request streaming buffer queue size
* **request-timeout** : how long a request can take to arrive (sec)
* **response-timeout** : how long a response can take to process (sec)
* **keep-alive**: keep-alive 
* **keep-alive-timeout**: how long to hold a TCP connection open (sec)
* **graceful-shutdown_timeout** : how long to wait to force close non-idle connection (sec)
* **workers** : number of workers for the service on a node
* **associated-environement** : if one of previous field is on the associated environment variables that allows to replace the  default one. This field is not mandatory.

  * **request-max-size** : overwrite with environement variable
  * **request-buffer-queue-size**: overwrite with environement variable
  * **request-timeout** : overwrite with environement variable
  * **response-timeout** : overwrite with environement variable
  * **keep-alive**: overwrite with environement variable
  * **keep-alive-timeout**: overwrite with environement variable
  * **graceful-shutdown_timeout** : overwrite with environement variable
  * **workers** : overwrite with environement variable
  

===========================
Cluster Inference service
===========================


To run the command type simply from searchai directory:

.. code-block:: shell 
  
    python3 thot/clusterinfer_svc.py --config=<path to configuration file>

A light client can be run through the command

.. code-block:: shell 
  
    python3 thot/clusterinfer_client.py --config=<path to configuration file> --input=<input directory> --output=<output directory>



=========================
Cluster Inference Tests
=========================

The converter service come with unit and functional testing. 


Cluster Inference Unit tests
------------------------------

Unittest allows to test Cluster Inference classes only.

.. code-block:: shell 

  python3 -m unittest thot/tests/unittests/TestRelationClusterizerConfiguration.py
  python3 -m unittest thot/tests/unittests/TestClusterInference.py

 

Cluster Inference Functional tests
------------------------------------

.. code-block:: shell 

  python3 -m unittest thot/tests/functional_tests/TestClusterInferSvc.py
