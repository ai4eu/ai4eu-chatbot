=====================

By default the tools does not use SSL. 
All the services provide a way to run on SSL layer. A self signed certificate is provided to test HTTPS but it is mandatory to have signed certicates in production mode.

When you run a service

.. code-block:: shell 
  
    python3 thot/<service>_svc.py --config=<path to service configuration file>

The confguration file describre network access. 

Example of Configuration:

.. literalinclude:: configuration/examples/networkconfiguration.json
    :language: json


The ssl networks fields:
  
  
* **ssl** : ssl configuration **IN PRODUCTION IT IS MANDATORY TO USE CERTIFICATE AND KEY THAT ARE *NOT* SELF SIGNED**
  
  * **cert** : certificate file
  * **key** : key file 

are not mandatory. The provide a way do define the certicate associated to https scheme
